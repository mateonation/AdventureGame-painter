## DESCRIPTION
"AdventureGame-painter" is a tool very useful to design levels for my ["AdventureGame"](https://github.com/mateonation/AdventureGame-WIP).
It shows the 51x25 grid used on that game. The user can paint the grid cells of each of the game elements by clicking on each of them. It even can position the spawn point where the player should spawn in the level and the goal to reach.
